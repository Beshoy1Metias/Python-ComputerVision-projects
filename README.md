Mouse Control Using Human Tracking and Gestures
Welcome to the Mouse Control Using Human Tracking and Gestures repository! This project demonstrates innovative methods to control a computer mouse using Python, leveraging computer vision and hand/eye tracking techniques.

Projects Overview
1. Eye Tracking and Gesture Control
This program allows users to control the mouse pointer using eye movements and gestures. By analyzing real-time video input from a webcam, it tracks the user's eyes to guide the cursor's position and detects specific gestures to perform mouse actions like clicking or scrolling.

Key Features:

Cursor movement guided by eye gaze direction.
Gesture-based commands for left-click, right-click, and drag operations.
Implements computer vision techniques using OpenCV and other Python libraries.
2. Index and Thumb Finger Tracking
This program uses hand tracking to control the mouse pointer. By detecting and tracking the index finger and thumb, users can move the cursor and execute gestures for mouse actions.

Key Features:

Cursor control via the relative position of the index finger and thumb.
Pinch gesture for clicks and drag functionality.
Optimized for responsiveness and minimal lag using Python libraries like Mediapipe and OpenCV.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run these projects, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or later
OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
